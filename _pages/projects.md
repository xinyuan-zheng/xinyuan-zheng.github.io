<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/images/mr2sv2a.png" alt="" style="width: 300px; margin-right: 20px;">
  <p>This research developed an image translation method from T1w MRI (and/or [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET) to [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J SV2A brain PET. A 3D multi-stage residual U-Net with supervised attention was proposed for the image-to-image fast inference.

### Noise reduction for NeuroEXPLORER: A Multi-Tracer Investigation
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/images/nx_denoise.png" alt="" style="width: 300px; margin-right: 20px;">
  <p>This project aims to develop denoising models for the ultra-high-sensitivity NeuroEXPLORER (NX) brain PET images across multiple tracers. Modified U-Nets and DDIM were implemented for the task of noise reduction across multiple tracers and count levels. The unified 3D models performed robustly for tracers including [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG, [<sup>18</sup>F]SynVesT-1, [<sup>18</sup>F]Flubatine, [<sup>18</sup>F]FE-PE2I, [<sup>18</sup>F]FPEB, [<sup>11</sup>C]LSN3172176, [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride and [<sup>11</sup>C]-(+)-PHNO.

### Direct estimation of arterial input function from dynamic brain PET imaging

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/images/aif.png" alt="" style="width: 300px; margin-right: 20px;">
  <p> To achieve the estimation of arterial input function (AIF) without blood sampling, we developed a modified transformer to estimate metabolite corrected input function directly from dynamic images. TACs of various brain ROIs extracted from dynamic [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J images were served as inputs for predicting metabolite AIFs. Incorporating PET imaging physics, the model employed a loss function with frame-specific weighting to account for radioactive decay. Population-based input function was integrated using a derivative-based shape loss.

### Super resolution for mCT/HRRT scanners

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/images/sr.png" alt="" style="width: 300px; margin-right: 20px;">
  <p> In this project, we aim to achieve super resolution for clinical mCT images, enhancing their resolution from approximately 4 mm to around 2.5 mm, matching the resolution of an HRRT scanner, and ultimately to 1.5 mm, comparable to the NX system. We adapted the idea of dense connections and proposed a densely connected network. Our preliminary results support the development of generative image restoration methods for brain PET image enhancement.

### CT-free attenuation correction for mCT/NX scanners
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/images/nx_mumap.png" alt="" style="width: 300px; margin-right: 20px;">
  <p> To achieve CT-free attenuation correction for NX, we developed a 3D attention U-net with transfer learning to generate ùúá-maps from non-attenuation-corrected (NAC) images. The network was trained on whole-body NAC mCT scans and the corresponding ùúá-maps. We then fine-tuned the network using only 3 NX scans to generate ùúá-maps for NX system. This project aims to explore the potential of adapting networks to bridge the domain gap in value distribution and resolution differences between scanners/vendors using very limited data.

### A Feature Reduction and Visualization Tool for the Diagnosis of ASD based on rs-fMRI
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/images/dvae_visual.png" alt="" style="width: 300px; margin-right: 20px;">
  <p> We proposed a feature reduction and visualization tool for ASD detection using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). Our approach employed a denoising variational autoencoder (DVAE) for dimensionality reduction, effectively encoded diagnostic information, reducing over 30,000 features to 1/3500 of their original size. The approach enables the interpretation of extracted latent representations by computing the network distribution of the latent features and visualizing them on brain maps.
