<b>Hello!</b> <br/> 
I am a 3-year PhD student in Biomedical Engineering at Yale University, co-advised by Prof. <a href="https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/chi-liu">Chi Liu</a> and Prof. <a href="https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/richard-e-carson">Richard E. Carson</a>. I am also a student in the <a href="https://physics-engineering-biology.yale.edu/">PEB</a> program and a recipient of the <a href="https://wti.yale.edu/">Wu-Tsai</a> Graduate Fellowship. Before joining Yale, I received my Master's degree in Statistics at Columbia University and my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics with Finance at University of Liverpool and Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University. Currently, my research focuses on deep learning and brain PET imaging techniques, as I work on related projects at the <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/pet/">Yale PET Center</a>. The members of my thesis committee are Prof. <a href="https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/chi-liu">Chi Liu</a>, Prof. <a href="https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/richard-e-carson">Richard E. Carson</a>, Prof. <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/rajiv-radhakrishnan/">Rajiv Radhakrishnan</a>, and Prof. <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/diagnosticradiology/profile/xiaofeng-liu/">Xiaofeng Liu</a>.
